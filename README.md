# ncm-ci
CI tool for [NCM 2.0](https://github.com/nodesource/ncm)

## About

From the onboarding doc:

> ### A command-line simplified version of the Electron app
> The primary use-case for this is the CI/CD story. It will run the Local Proxy and use the same format config file as the Electron App to let CICD systems interface with the registry.
